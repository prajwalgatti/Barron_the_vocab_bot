A friendly bot with an extensive, broad vocabulary!

A Twitter bot to tweet random definitions from the Barron's 800 High Frequency GRE word list to help me prepare for GRE.

It publishes one tweet every 12 hours. To look up word definitions, it goes inside `dir_to_lookup`, then opens the file `barrons800.txt` to randomly choose a word.

Someday I would like to make it a spaced repetition bot.

Right now, it is posting from its Twitter acc: [botvocab](https://twitter.com/botvocab)  :heart:
